## Linux Computing

The operating system of choice in the field of cybersecurity. Students will be given an in-depth introduction to the OS, including hands-on experience where they will work through a level-based set of challenges through OverTheWire's Bandit. (https://overthewire.org)

## Virtualization & Emulation

Ever wonder how it's possible to play N64 games on modern PCs and cell phones? We will explore this topic and how it is useful in the world of cybersecurity. Students will gain experience setting up their own virtual linux environments.

## Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures

Students will be introduced to some of the most commonly known CVEs, catalogued by Mitre. Students will learn about what a vulnerability is, how it is documented, and how it is distributed. Students will also demonstrate the use of a real-world web-based vulnerability.

## Networking

Before reviewing the fundamentals of networking, students will be shown a wireless de-authentication attack, which will demonstrate just how easy network-based attacks can be to execute. Students will also be introduced to some of the most commone attack and defense strategies utilized at the enterprise level.

## Exploitation Development & Deployment

Students will be introduced to how exploits are developed using the Metasploit Framework. Students will learn how to scan a machine connected to a network for common vulnerabilities, and then apply that research into an actual exploit for that machine.

## Malware Analysis

Students will be introduced to the dangers of malware, learning how to appropriate handle and sandbox it. Students will gain hands-on experience with malware that has been used in the real-world, utilizing a suite of advanced tools that allow for isolated analysis.

## Capture the Flag

How does someone practice these advanced techniques in the field of cybersecurity? CTFs are competitions held worldwide where problems of all skill levels are hosted for practice and rewards. Students will be introduced to the concept of CTFs and be exposed to some actual CTF problems.

## Software Reverse Engineering

What if I told you that you could figure out how any piece of software worked even if you didn't have the original source code? Introducing Reverse Engineering. Students will be exposed to advanced tools and concepts utilized in the field of SRE, being exposed to dificult CTF challenges.
